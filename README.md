##Advent Of Code
http://adventofcode.com/

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit to this repository.  Fork the project, create a folder with the format `{YourName}-{YourLang}` and begin working.

For example, if I wanted to start working on Advent of Code in F# I would create a folder "ReidEvans-FSharp".  If I then wanted to work on Erlang I'd create an additional folder "ReidEvans-Erlang"
